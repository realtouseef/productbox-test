## Approach to the problem

## TODOs

- https://javascript.plainenglish.io/creating-a-persistent-cart-in-react-f287ed4b4df0
- https://github.com/AlexSegen/react-shopping-cart/blob/master
- when Add to cart button is clicked, replace it with remove from cart
- create context
- for global states, use useContext

## Completed TODOs

- add the items in api/products and fetch them
- fetch the data on the frontend

## expected outcome

- add a cart option to the top of each page, shows how many items are added to the cart
  -- once the cart is clicked, takes you to checkout page where you can see all the chosen items

- use Local Storage for implementing the **cart** functionality
